		QUESTION

<div class="qa">

<ol class="qa">
<li class="q">Why did more client output result when you added the loop
to read extra messages after each successful message receipt? Why
were some messages never printed? Why were some printed late and out
of order?</li>
<li class="a">
The server outputted the correct amount of messages everytime without me 
needing to read extra messages, but I would assume we would need to if the 
packets came late from the server. Some messages were never printed probably 
because it didn't reach the client or server (mine did). Some were printed 
late or out of order because a packet chose a different, possible faster or 
slower path (mine was completely fine).
</li>

<li class="q">What was confusing about this assignment or 
programming framework that we should
explain in more detail before proceeding to the next assignment?</li>
<li class="a">
The nastiness level didn't change anything as far as I could see except for 
level 1 introducing the need to reread and level 4 outputting a message that 
I send a while ago.
</li>


<li class="q">How much UDP (datagram) style programming did you already know before doing this assignment?</li>
<li class="a">
None
</li>
