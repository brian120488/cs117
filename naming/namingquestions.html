 <div class="qa">
<p>Please answer each of the following questions.</p>


<ol class="qa">
<li class="q">
Please make a list of issues or design characteristics that one
should consider in designing a naming system.
List as many as you can (within reason). You should use this as an opportunity to 
show your mastery of the naming concepts we have been discussing in the class.
I'll start you with a couple:
</li>
<li class="a">
Issues and design characteristics that should be considered when
designing a new naming system include:
<ul>
<li>What should be nameable using this naming system?</li>
<li>Where and how will the names be used, and by whom?</li>
<li>Will this interfere with any current naming system?</li>
<li>Will one's name be the same and mean the same no matter where you are?</li>
<li>Can certain names be "similar" and what does that suggest about them?</li>
<li>How are names distributed and owned?</li>
<li>When are two names "the same"?</li>
<li>What form should the names be?, and what about names that do not follow that form?</li>
<li>Can and how can names be changed?</li>
<li>How accessible and known are these names?</li>
<li>Can two things have the same name?</li>
<li>Can something have multiple names?</li>
<li>Are there "nicknames"?</li>
<li>What characters (is it even characters) are allowed?</li>
<li>What can you learn just by looking at the name?</li>
<li>How do the named objects interact/relate with one another?</li>
</ul>
				      
</li>

<li class="q">Choose an existing naming system that interests you.
Examples include file naming in Unix/Linux systems, the phone
numbers discussed in your reading, etc. Many good examples
are related to computer systems, but if you prefer 
you can choose something else. 
<br>
<br>
For the system you choose, <em>explain the system you choose in sufficient detail so that someone who had never seen it before would understand the rest of your analysis</em>.
Explain where the system is used, and what can be named, what names look like and what the rules for assigning them are, etc. Then briefly explain 
how the system you choose does or does not deal with the issues you list above. 
Again, <em>the goal is to show your ability to apply the principles and insights we discussed in class</em>.
If your list above is very long, then just choose up to 8 important ones to deal with here.
WARNING: Don't assume that <em>you</em> know how a system works. In past years we've had many students give incorrect descriptions of, e.g. what the limitations are on Linux filenames, or what can be named with such names, because students based their answers on personal experience or assumptions rather than on how Linux really works. As in all technical writing, make sure that your explanations are correct! Even for systems you use a lot, you might want to find the specifications.
</li>
<li class="a">
    Linux File System

    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>What to name:</b> You can name "files", things with data, such as directories, code, 
            images, etc. They have global names, which are their entire file paths, and local relative names,
            which is the name of the file itself.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Characters:</b>
            You can use upper and lowercase letters, numbers, ".", "-", and "_".
            You can use other special characters such as blank space, but they are 
            hard to use and it is better to avoid them. You cannot use the null character.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Relation of Files:</b> "/" is reserved as the separator 
            between files and directories in a pathname. If used correctly, 
            files in the same directory are most likely related due to them 
            being in the same directory.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Permissions:</b> Generally, if you have write permission to a 
            directory you can rename any file in that directory. If you have read 
            permission, you can view the contents of a file or list the contents of a directory.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Inconsistency: </b> The name and file extension has no 
            guarantee on a file's data.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Multiple Names: </b> You can create more than one name for the same file by
            creating "hard links".
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Uniqueness:</b> A filename must be unique inside its directory. For example, 
            inside /home/vivek directory you cannot create a demo.txt file 
            and demo.txt directory name. However, other directory may have 
            files with the same names. For example, you can create demo.txt directory in /tmp.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Equality: </b> Two names are the same if their corresponding 
            files contain the same data. This is used using the "diff" command.
        </li>
    </ul>
</ol>
