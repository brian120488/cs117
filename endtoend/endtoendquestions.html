 <div class="qa">
<p>You are welcome to write as much as you like, but this is not intended to be a very time-consuming assignment.  In most cases, each question can be answered in one or a few sentences, but it is essential that you demonstrate strong understanding. Try to get to the essence quickly. If you want to provide supporting detail, that's fine too.</p>
<p>
  Note that the end-to-end paper discusses, starting in its abstract, an end-to-end <em>design principle</em>, and many of these questions are about that principle. Make sure you understand what the principle is before attempting to answer these questions. Indeed, it's worth returning to the abstract after you've read the whole paper, but the abstract emphasizes only some of what's important. We will also discuss the principle in detail in class, and you may update your answers after that discussion.  Indeed, don't worry if there are a few questions that you don't know how to answer at all  until after the class discussion.
</p>

<ol class="qa">
<li class="q">
    Briefly summarize the "end-to-end" principle in your own words. Why does 
    it matter? In what situations is it applicable? What does it say about the 
    pros and cons of doing other sorts of checking and recovery (I.e. other than end-to-end)?  
    For full credit it must be clear when checking is required, when it's optional, and why.
</li>
<li class="a">
    The "end-to-end" principle asserts that certain functions in a system 
    should be implemented at the application level rather than the lower 
    levels of the system if those functions are essential to the correctness 
    of the application. This principle matters because it can avoid redundancy and 
    unnecessary complexity. It is applicable in situations where lower-level 
    components alone cannot fully meet the correctness of the system. However,
    low-level checks can help the performance of the application. 
</li>

<li class="q">The end-to-end paper describes a situation at MIT in which end-to-end checking was not done, and
the result was a system that did not work well enough. What was the problem, and how would more attention to
the end-to-end argument have helped?
</li>
<li class="a">
    MIT had a problem, in which a failure in a network system where 
    checksums at each gateway overlooked errors in data stored within the 
    gateways themselves. More attention to the end-to-end argument would have 
    quickly verified there was something wrong with the data transfer process 
    and would have prevented the file corruptions.
</li>

<li class="q">The end-to-end principle discusses the impact of various design choices on system <em>correctness</em>. What are the implications of attention to the end-to-end <em>principle</em> for system performance? Briefly discuss.</li>
<li class="a">
    Focusing on the low-level system may improve performance; however, by 
    applying the end-to-end principle to the overarching application, can 
    prove to be simpler, faster, and more reliable by removing the redudancies 
    or need of low-level functions.
</li>

<li class="q">If a networking system with multiple "hops" does error checking and recovery on some of the individual links, does that violate the end-to-end principle? <em>Briefly</em> explain why or why not. Remember: this question is not asking whether such checking is ever a good idea (though you might want to comment on that too), this question is asking what the <em>principle</em> says, if anything, about such checking.</li>
<li class="a">
    No, performing that does not violate the end-to-end principle. The 
    principle emphasizes that critical functions, such as ensuring data 
    integrity, should be handled end-to-end 
    by the application. Extra lower-level error checking and recovery are fine and can improve 
    performance and overall correctness between the processes.
</li>

<li class="q">Do systems designed with attention to the end-to-end principle tend to be simpler or more complex, I.e. compared to otherwise similar systems designed without attention to the principle? Briefly discuss.</li>
<li class="a">
    Systems designed with attention to the end-to-end principle tend to be 
    simpler because they avoid duplicating functions across layers by 
    focusing lower-level components on basic tasks and leaving more specific 
    functionalities to higher levels.
</li>

<li class="q">Consider the postal system. Letters are typically addressed, mailed and delivered without
explicit acknowledgement. How, if at all,
does the "end-to-end" argument apply to the postal system?</li>
<li class="a">
    The "end-to-end" argument applies to the postal system because the 
    integrity of the letter is mostly handled by the users rather than the 
    low-level postal infrastructure. Letters are acknowledged by the 
    end-to-end users with another letter that they have received and read the 
    letter.
</li>


<li class="q">Paul Baran explains why packet switching could not have
been successful in an all-analog world. Why was digital messaging a
necessary pre-requisite for the adoption of packet switching? Be
specific.</li>
<li class="a">
    The network involved multiple links, which analog couldn't handle
    because analog wasn't accurate enough compared to digital.
</li>

<li class="q">What reason does Baran give why packet switching can
make a network achieve similar performance at less cost than a
circuit-switched network?</li>

<li class="a">
    Packet switching was much more flexible and dynamic, so if there
    was an overload, traffic would just go around it. 
</li>

<li class="q">What reaction did Baran get from the experts at AT&amp;T when he proposed packet-switching? Why?</li>
<li class="a">
    They were ignorant and dismissed using packet-switching. They 
    were skeptical that it would actually work and saw it as a threat to 
    their company's future.
</li>

<li class="q">Why did or didn't Baran seek patents on his work?</li>
<li class="a">
    The 17 years went by very quickly for him, and he wanted everyone to be 
    able to use it.
</li>

<li class="q">(optional: for fun not credit) What efforts were made to keep this technology secret from the "enemy" in the Soviet Union? Why?</li>
<li class="a">...your answer here...</li>
