<div class="qa">

<ol class="qa">
<li class="q">What are the highest "nastiness" levels at which you believe your program will
successfully copy an entire directory full of files? (We will test your programs using those levels
on both the client and the server; if all you got working
was the end-to-end check, then please tell us how to test your work. <em>Also: if high network nastiness messes up your ability to deal with file nastiness, you can give us two pairs: e.g. Test my client and server with networknastiness=4 and filenastiness=1 or networknastiness=0 and filenastiness=3)</em></li>
<li class="a">
<!-- replace XX and YY with the actual values -->
Please test my client and server with: networknastiness=XX and filenastiness=YY.
</li>

<li class="q">Is there anything else we should
know about testing your code, or what you expect it to do
(beyond what's explained in your report below)?</li>
<li class="a">
it is slow
</li>

<li class="q">Did you get help from anyone other than your teammate? If "yes", then briefly explain who helped you and how.</li>
<li class="a">
We discussed our protocols with David.

<li class="q">(optional) Do you have any other comments on this assignment (e.g. was it worthwhile, what did you learn from it, do you have suggestions for improvment if the course is offered again)?</li>

The main part of the report will be an explanation of your approach, what you think you've achieved, and what we should expect when we test your code. We want to know what your code is doing, and we want you to explain why it does or does not work in particular cases. For example, if you know that delayed packets will cause your program to get confused as to which file it's working on, tell us. If you think you're handling that case, explain the technique you're using to keep things straight.

Overall, your report should cover:

Overview: what did you do? What worked and what didn't?
Which cases do you think your code handles and why?
Describe your protocol:
What is the sequence of packets you send in the normal cases and for recovery?
What is the structure of your packets? Briefly explain each significant field. You can copy/paste the actual structs if you like, but include enough commentary (in the structs or below it) that we can figure out what's going on.
What's your approach to dealing with lost packets? Packets that are reordered?
Are there any invariants that give you confidence in the correctness of your protocol (e.g. "My rename is done after my end-to-end check succeeds, so any TARGET file without a .TMP suffix is correct")
Do you expect your code to succeed when there are errors reading or writing the disk? What ensures that it will succeed, or why do you think it might not?
Are there bugs or shortcomings you know about? Are they indicated in comments in the code with NEEDSWORK? (see commenting and code quality)
What should we look for in the grading logs? Please relate this to your explanation of the protocol you've invented (if you like, you can combine the two, indicating gradelog entries as you explain the protocol, or you can explain the gradelog separately).
Which cases are you aware of (e.g. high nastiness levels or particular combinations of reordering) that you aren't trying to handle correctly? In such cases, will your code detect the problem and abort (OK) or will it silently produce incorrect results?
If your code has to give up copying one file, will it go on and try others? This can be a good thing to do. Certain protocols will tend to succeed on short files, but not on longer ones. If this is true of yours, can you explain why? If you have this problem, what file sizes do you handle at which nastiness levels, and how long does it typically take for them to be copied?
Are there any cases for which your code doesn't do what you expect? Do you have any intuition why that might be?
What did you learn from this asssignment?
Include anything else that will demonstrate your understanding of this assignment and your results. Your comments on the assignment, and suggestions for future revisions of it are also welcome. Also, please include a statement confirming that both team members were present for (substantially) all coding, and that both worked out the design together (obviously, you can do some individual design work, but it should be roughly balanced, and you and your team mate must make all final decisions together, and with shared understanding.)
