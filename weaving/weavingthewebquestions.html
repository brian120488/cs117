 <div class="qa">

<ol class="qa">
<li class="q">Describe briefly Tim Berners-Lee's reasons for creating the Web. What influenced him to build it,
in what environment was he working, and what were the short and long term goals he was trying to achieve (a paragraph
or two is fine &#8212; this is just to make sure you are up on the background for Tim's work) </li>
<li class="a">
    Influenced by childhood book named <i>Enquire Within upon Everything</i>, 
    Tim was set on building a "portal to a world of information". This idea 
    of building a web of connections like the human brain stuck 
    with him throughout his education and career. Eventually, he became a 
    software consultant at CERN, a national particle physics research 
    laboratory. His short term goal was to create a mini World Wide Web for his 
    lab and link all the researchers, computers, and projects together into 
    one global information space. His long term goal was to eventually spread 
    this project worldwide so that everyone, no matter what machines they had 
    or technologies they used, could easily access information from around 
    the world.
</li>

<li class="q">Identify and briefly describe at least eight technical challenges that had to be met as Tim created the Web. 
<em>You will not find all the answers set out explicitly in the book. Use your knowledge of computer
systems and your imagination to figure out the sorts of challenges he would have to overcome.</em> Explain each of the eight briefly (one or a few sentences each, unless you care to say more) :</li>
<li class="a">Technical challenges included:
<ol>
    <li><b>Reason One:</b> It was hard to scale the project. There were 
        multiple instances where he had to make a decision whether to continue 
        using his current prototype's technologies or switch to a more 
        scalable or more accessible technology, such as switching from NeXT or 
        switching from Objective-C. 
    </li>

<li>
    <b>Reason Two:</b> He had to have a different, more flexible protocol so 
    that two entirely different machines could always communicate with each 
    other, so he created HTTP.
</li>
<li>
    <b>Reason Three:</b> Tim wanted to create a way to identify 
    documents in the web  equally so he invented the URI.
</li>
<li>
    <b>Reason Four:</b> SGML was slow and outdated, so Tim invented HTML to be 
    a quicker, simpler, and more flexible language to build the editor and 
    documents. It turned out that a lot more people than expected built 
    websites using the literal HTML.
</li>
<li>
    <b>Reason Five:</b> Hyperlinks can be faulty or outdated, so the Tim had 
    to account for that.
</li>
<li>
    <b>Reason Six:</b> There may have been an issue with privacy and security 
    since there is data being transmitted between two machines through the 
    Internet, so hackers may take advantage of this process.
</li>
<li>
    <b>Reason Seven:</b> Tim probably had to make sure multimedia content was 
    able to easily be uploaded, shared, and viewed, such as files, videos, and 
    audio messages. Including this is making sure, certain profane content is 
    somehow monitored or filtered.
<li>
    <b>Reason Eight:</b> The Internet wasn't as popular in Europe as it was in 
    America. So it was hard to convince anyone to switch to his product.
</li>
</ol>

</li>


<li class="q">Identify and briefly describe at least two organizational, legal and/or economic challenges that had to be met as Tim created the Web. Explain each briefly:</li>
<li class="a">Organizational, legal or economic challenges included:
<ol>
<li>
    <b>Reason One:</b> Developing the Web wasn't a formal project assigned by 
    CERN. Despite being employed by CERN to do software work, Tim was just 
    pursuing his individual endeavors. To solve this, his proposal needed to 
    get attention and proper approval from CERN. But in order to get proper 
    approval from CERN, his project had to show promise and already have a 
    successful prototype.
</li>
<li>
    <b>Reason Two:</b> Additionally, it was hard to get people to switch to the 
    Web, not only around the world but even in CERN. It was hard to stand 
    out in a research facility, especially a physics research facility, where 
    there was innovation everywhere. Therefore, most people were not impressed 
    by Tim's prototypes of the Web. Furthermore, it costs money, time, and 
    resources to for clients change infrastructure and switch to the Web, which some 
    other companies were not willing to do for Tim.
