<li class="a">
<!-- Update the following by inluding the absolute URI in both the href and text -->
<!-- Remember: your absolute URI must begin with 
     https://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~<yourloginname> -->

<li class="q">How much HTML and CSS did you already know before starting this assignment?</li>
<li class="a">
I have built websites before.
</li>

<li class="q">This assignment requires that you demonstrate at least three HTML features and at least three CSS features that you had not used before. Please list them (more than three is fine):</li>
<li class="a">
HTML Features:
<ul>
    <li>Span</li>

</ul>
CSS Features:
<ul>
    <li>Styling tables by selecting its children</li>
    <li>Gradients</li>
    <li>Media queries</li>
</ul>
<!-- you can replace this comment with more text if there's more you'd like to discuss -->
</li>


<li class="q">Explain briefly the difference between a &lt;div> and a &lt;span></li>
<li class="a">
Divs creates a new block for organizing and styling elements, but span does its inline, usually used for texts.
</li>

<li class="q">What help did you receive from others? (You don't have to
indicate if someone just told you in general about an interesting HTML or CSS feature, or if they gave general
ideas for making your Web page(s) more interesting, but
you must identify any help you received with learning how to write or debug your code.)</li>
<li class="a">
None  
</li>

<li class="q">Is there anything else we should know about grading your work (e.g. links we need to follow to see more)?</li>
<li class="a">
No
</li>


<li class="q">Did you do any work for <a href="htmlassignment#extracredit">extra credit</a>?</li>
<li class="a">
No 
</li>


<li class="q">(will not be graded) Do you have any questions about learning HTML? Anything you'd like to see covered more carefully in class?:</li>
<li class="a">
No
</li>
